I've found I don't have enough time to finish this project, yet I still use it everyday. Rather than let it die slowly, I'm open sourcing it, hoping it will find an audience.

# What is it?

PlayBar is a simple way to stream and queue MP3 files. It was designed for the purpose of listening to hour long podcasts without needed a separate window/dock icon (Quicktime) or having to add the files to any sort of database (iTunes).

You can download and open MP3s directly or drag a URL to the icon to have it stream directly. If a podcast is playing, PlayBar will queue the next one up.

Clicking the icon brings up the window, right-clicking brings up the menu, and middle-clicking pauses the episode.

# What's needed?

The design is a little lacking. It has some polish, but the text parsing is very, very poor. The title doesn't show up 50% of the time, and the playlist shows a confusing URL.
